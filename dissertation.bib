Given two functions we find a trace alignment over a set of concrete executions of both programs and construct a product program particularly amenable to checking equivalence. We demonstrate that our algorithm is applicable to challenging equivalence problems beyond the scope of existing techniques. For example, we verify the correctness of the hand-optimized vector implementation of strlen that ships as part of the GNU C Library, as well as the correctness of vectorization optimizations for 56 benchmarks derived from the Test Suite for Vectorizing Compilers.},

	abstract = {We target the problem of automatically synthesizing proofs of semantic equivalence between two programs made of sequences of statements. We represent programs using abstract syntax trees (AST), where a given set of semantics-preserving rewrite rules can be applied on a specific AST pattern to generate a transformed and semantically equivalent program. In our system, two programs are equivalent if there exists a sequence of application of these rewrite rules that leads to rewriting one program into the other. We propose a neural network architecture based on a transformer model to generate proofs of equivalence between program pairs. The system outputs a sequence of rewrites, and the validity of the sequence is simply checked by verifying it can be applied. If no valid sequence is produced by the neural network, the system reports the programs as non-equivalent, ensuring by design no programs may be incorrectly reported as equivalent. Our system is fully implemented for one single grammar which can represent straight-line programs with function calls and multiple types. To efficiently train the system to generate such sequences, we develop an original incremental training technique, named self-supervised sample selection. We extensively study the effectiveness of this novel training approach on proofs of increasing complexity and length. Our system, {\textbackslash}mathsf S4EqS4Eq, achieves 97\% proof success on a curated dataset of 10,000 pairs of equivalent programs.},

	abstract = {Relational verification encompasses information flow security, regression verification, translation validation for compilers, and more. Effective alignment of the programs and computations to be related facilitates use of simpler relational invariants and relational procedure specs, which in turn enables automation and modular reasoning. Alignment has been explored in terms of trace pairs, deductive rules of relational Hoare logics (RHL), and several forms of product automata. This article shows how a simple extension of Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT), called BiKAT, subsumes prior formulations, including alignment witnesses for forall-exists properties, which brings to light new RHL-style rules for such properties. Alignments can be discovered algorithmically or devised manually but, in either case, their adequacy with respect to the original programs must be proved; an explicit algebra enables constructive proof by equational reasoning. Furthermore our approach inherits algorithmic benefits from existing KAT-based techniques and tools, which are applicable to a range of semantic models.},

For a synthesis tool to compete with modern compilers, its equivalence checker should be able to verify the transformations produced by these compilers. We find that the transformations produced by compilers are much varied and the presence of undefined behaviour allows them to produce even more aggressive optimizations. Previous work on equivalence checking has been done in the context of translation validation, where either a pass-by-pass based approach was employed or a set of handpicked optimizations were proven. These settings are not suitable for a synthesis tool where a black-box approach is required.},

For a synthesis tool to compete with modern compilers, its equivalence checker should be able to verify the transformations produced by these compilers. We find that the transformations produced by compilers are much varied and the presence of undefined behaviour allows them to produce even more aggressive optimizations. Previous work on equivalence checking has been done in the context of translation validation, where either a pass-by-pass based approach was employed or a set of handpicked optimizations were proven. These settings are not suitable for a synthesis tool where a black-box approach is required.},

abstract = {The Rust programming language provides a powerful type system that checks linearity and borrowing, allowing code to safely manipulate memory without garbage collection and making Rust ideal for developing low-level, high-assurance systems. For such systems, formal verification can be useful to prove functional correctness properties beyond type safety. This paper presents Verus, an SMT-based tool for formally verifying Rust programs.  
With Verus, programmers express proofs and specifications using the Rust language, allowing proofs to take advantage of Rust's linear types and borrow checking. We show how this allows proofs to manipulate linearly typed permissions that let Rust code safely manipulate memory, pointers, and concurrent resources. Verus organizes proofs and specifications using a novel mode system that distinguishes specifications, which are not checked for linearity and borrowing, from executable code and proofs, which are checked for linearity and borrowing.  
We formalize Verus' linearity, borrowing, and modes in a small lambda calculus, for which we prove type safety and termination of specifications and proofs. We demonstrate Verus on a series of examples, including pointer-manipulating code (an xor-based doubly linked list), code with interior mutability, and concurrent code.},

abstract = {In this paper, we explore the concept of code readability and investigate its relation to software quality. With data collected from 120 human annotators, we derive associations between a simple set of local code features and human notions of readability. Using those features, we construct an automated readability measure and show that it can be 80 percent effective and better than a human, on average, at predicting readability judgments. Furthermore, we show that this metric correlates strongly with three measures of software quality: code changes, automated defect reports, and defect log messages. We measure these correlations on over 2.2 million lines of code, as well as longitudinally, over many releases of selected projects. Finally, we discuss the implications of this study on programming language design and engineering practice. For example, our data suggest that comments, in and of themselves, are less important than simple blank lines to local judgments of readability.},
