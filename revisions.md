# Dissertation Revision Tasks

## Current Thesis Statement

**Original:**
> Software engineering is an evolving process, including testing, debugging, and migration. Open-source, code assisting language models are commonly pre-trained on causal code generation (i.e., left-to-right). This limits their value in software maintenance and evolution tasks, which require a wholistic understanding of software properties. Adding an understanding of software properties through program analysis can assist in important steps of the software evolution process and mitigate the limitations of a language model.

## Proposed Revised Thesis Statements

### Option 1: Evidence-Based with Novel Contributions (Recommended)
>
> Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on causal code generation excel at producing natural code but lack the semantic understanding required for software maintenance tasks. This dissertation demonstrates that integrating LLMs with program analysis techniques produces measurably superior results across fault localization, automated program repair, and program transpilation compared to either LLM or program analysis in isolation. Specifically, this work introduces four novel integration techniques: bidirectional adapter fine-tuning that enables test-free fault localization on real-world bugs and security vulnerabilities, entropy-based "naturalness" quantification that improves all three stages of automated program repair, verification-guided transpilation that achieves functional correctness guarantees while maintaining code naturalness, and LLM static analysis concatenated fine-tuning for vulnerablity detection. These contributions establish that hybrid neural-symbolic approaches consistently outperform pure neural or symbolic methods for tasks related to software evolution.

### Option 2: Concise Problem-Solution Focus
>
> While LLMs demonstrate strong code generation capabilities, their application to software evolution tasks is limited by their training on left-to-right generation and lack of semantic understanding. This dissertation addresses this limitation by developing hybrid approaches that augment LLMs with program analysis through bidirectional fine-tuning for fault localization, entropy-guided uncertainty quantification for program repair, and verification-integrated transpilation. Empirical evaluation on real-world defects demonstrates that these integrations systematically outperform both traditional program analysis and standalone LLM approaches, establishing the value of combining neural and symbolic methods for software maintenance.
